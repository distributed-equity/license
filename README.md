# Distributed Equity License (DEL) v1.0

Welcome to the official repository of the **Distributed Equity License (DEL)** ‚Äî a modular, declarative, machine-readable license framework built for the age of AI.

This repository hosts the **canonical Markdown version** of the license text:

üìÑ [del-v1.0.md](./del-v1.0.md)

---

## üåç Why DEL?

Artificial intelligence is being trained on vast amounts of creative content ‚Äî often without permission, payment, or attribution. The Distributed Equity License provides a **simple, ethical, and enforceable way** for authors to declare what rights they grant (or deny) to AI systems and humans alike.

DEL empowers creators to embed their intent directly into their work using **inline tags** that are both human- and machine-readable.

---

## üß† What Makes DEL Different?

- ‚úÖ **Markdown-native** and versioned
- ‚úÖ **Modular flag system** (e.g. `trainable`, `quotable`, `noai`)
- ‚úÖ **Inline tag format** (`{{DEL:flag1 flag2}}...{{/DEL:flag1}}`)
- ‚úÖ **Built for AI comprehension**
- ‚úÖ **Supports micropayments**, content hashes, and attribution via wallet addresses
- ‚úÖ **Legally binding under the Berne Convention**

## üßæ Current Version

**Version**: 1.0  
**Block ID**: #0000000001  
**Filename**: [`del-v1.0.md`](./del-v1.0.md)  
**Author**: Kevin Ryan, Founder, [DistributedEquity.org](https://distributedequity.org)

## üîß Usage

To apply DEL to your own creative work:

1. Include a top-level license declaration like:

    ```markdown
    {{DEL:quotable percent=10 notrain}}
    My creative content goes here...
    {{/DEL:quotable}}
    ```

2. Include any relevant metadata such as:

    ```yaml
    license_flags: ["quotable", "notrain"]
    author: "Jane Example"
    license_uri: "https://github.com/distributed-equity/licence/blob/main/del-v1.0.md"
    ```

3. Make sure your work includes a reference or copy of the license.

## üß± Block Architecture

DEL content is organized into versioned **Blocks**, providing an optional proof of provenance and ownership.

Each Block represents a formally versioned artifact within the Distributed Equity ecosystem.

| Block | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `#0000000000` | **The DEL Manifesto v1.0** ‚Äî founding principles and intent |
| `#0000000001` | **The DEL License v1.0** ‚Äî [del-v1.0.md](./del-v1.0.md) |
| `#0000000002` | **The DEL Tag Specification v1.0** ‚Äî technical reference for tag syntax and behavior |
| `#0000000003+` | **Creative Works** licensed under DEL by creators, publishers, and organizations |

---

## ‚ú® Vision

The DEL protocol is designed for a future where:

- Creators are **respected** by machines
- Licensing is **transparent**, **enforceable**, and **interoperable**
- Attribution, micropayment, and consent are the **default**, not the exception
