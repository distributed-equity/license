# Distributed Equity License (DEL) v1.0

Welcome to the official repository of the **Distributed Equity License (DEL)** — a modular, declarative, machine-readable license framework built for the age of AI.

This repository hosts the **canonical Markdown version** of the license text:

📄 [del-v1.0.md](./del-v1.0.md)

---

## 🌍 Why DEL?

Artificial intelligence is being trained on vast amounts of creative content — often without permission, payment, or attribution. The Distributed Equity License provides a **simple, ethical, and enforceable way** for authors to declare what rights they grant (or deny) to AI systems and humans alike.

DEL empowers creators to embed their intent directly into their work using **inline tags** that are both human- and machine-readable.

---

## 🧠 What Makes DEL Different?

- ✅ **Markdown-native** and versioned
- ✅ **Modular flag system** (e.g. `trainable`, `quotable`, `noai`)
- ✅ **Inline tag format** (`{{DEL:flag1 flag2}}...{{/DEL:flag1}}`)
- ✅ **Built for AI comprehension**
- ✅ **Supports micropayments**, content hashes, and attribution via wallet addresses
- ✅ **Legally binding under the Berne Convention**

## 🔧 Usage

To apply DEL to your own creative work:

1. Include a top-level license declaration like:

    ```markdown
    {{DEL:quotable percent=10 notrain}}
    My creative content goes here...
    {{/DEL:quotable}}
    ```

2. Include any relevant metadata such as:

    ```yaml
    license_flags: ["quotable", "notrain"]
    author: "Jane Example"
    license_uri: "https://github.com/distributed-equity/licence/blob/main/del-v1.0.md"
    ```

3. Make sure your work includes a reference or copy of the license.
